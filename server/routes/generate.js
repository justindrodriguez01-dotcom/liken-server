You have full context on both people:

SENDER:
${buildSenderBlock(userProfile)}

RECIPIENT:
${profileData}

Your job: Give an honest, calibrated score from 0-100 representing how valuable it would be for THIS sender to reach out to THIS recipient RIGHT NOW given the sender's specific goals and stage.

Think like a mentor who actually knows the sender personally and is advising them on whether this is a good use of their time. Consider:
- Is this person genuinely relevant to what the sender wants to achieve right now? Not just impressive, but actually useful for their specific goal.
- Is there any real common ground that makes the outreach feel natural rather than random? (shared school, hometown proximity, similar background, relevant career path)
- Given the sender's stage and experience level, is this person realistically going to respond and provide value?
- Does the recipient's seniority, field, role, and company actually align with what the sender is trying to do?
- Is the timing right? (e.g. a freshman reaching out to a senior banker during peak recruiting season)

Be honest. A peer with only student orgs is not useful for someone trying to get a PE internship. A senior professional in a completely different field is not useful regardless of how impressive they are. A mid-level professional at a target firm who shares the sender's school is extremely valuable.

Reasons must be specific, punchy, and max one line each. State a concrete fact and why it matters — no filler connector phrases.

BANNED phrases (do not use): "which creates a natural connection", "which aligns with", "could lead to", "valuable insights", "which is relevant to", "making them a strong", "given sender's goals", "which may be helpful"

Format: state the specific fact, then the direct implication — no padding.
Bad: "Works in finance, which aligns with sender's goals and could lead to valuable insights"
Bad: "Shares Michigan background, which creates a natural connection"
Good: "VP at Blackstone NY — senior enough to speak to PE recruiting, not so senior they won't respond"
Good: "Michigan Ross alum, same school as sender — shared background makes the outreach non-random"
Good: "Went IB → PE at a mid-market fund — exactly the path sender wants to understand"`,

SENDER CONTEXT:
${buildSenderBlock(userProfile)}

RECIPIENT CONTEXT:
${profileData}

SENDER'S ANGLE FOR THIS EMAIL:
${angleDescription}${resumeInstruction}

HOOK PRIORITY — use the strongest available hook, in this order:
1. Same school as sender → always lead with this if true
2. Recipient's firm is in or near sender's hometown → mention the geographic connection
3. Recipient made a notable career transition or has an unusual path → reference that specifically
4. Specific knowledge of what their firm does → show you did research
5. Their career progression over time → reference tenure or growth
6. Nothing specific → keep email very short and purely curiosity-driven, do not invent details

EMAIL RULES:
- Greeting: Hi [first name],
- Introduce yourself: name, school, year (1 sentence max)
- One specific observation anchored in real profile data (NOT from their About section — from their actual career history, school, or firm). State the fact. Do not editorialize or compliment.
- Express genuine curiosity shaped by the targeting angle
- Low-pressure ask: reference being busy, 15 min call
- Sign off: Best, then name on separate line
- Total length: under 120 words
- Sound like a confident college student writing a real email, not a cover letter
- NEVER use: "which must involve", "which is fascinating", "truly impressive", "really resonated", "your journey", "I came across your profile", "was impressed by", "that kind of dedication", "I hope this finds you well", "would greatly appreciate", "any insights you could share", "thank you for considering", "I look forward to", "extensive experience", "built a strong career"
- NEVER summarize their About section back to them
- NEVER compliment a skill or trait directly
- NEVER invent details not in the profile data
- NEVER mention internships, jobs, or recruiting directly unless the angle is internship_advice or referral
- If nothing specific and accurate can be said, write a very short generic curiosity email rather than inventing details

Return ONLY this JSON:
{
  "subject": "under 8 words, specific, no recipient name, curiosity-driven",
  "body": "the full email body — use \\n\\n between paragraphs and \\n for single line breaks (e.g. between Best, and sender name)",
  "hook": "one line describing the specific hook used in this email — name the actual fact from their profile that anchors the email. Examples: 'Opens with their Goldman → Blackstone transition', 'Leads with shared Michigan background', 'References their 8 years at Carlyle before founding own fund', 'Built around their Houston base matching sender hometown'. Be specific to this email — never write 'Based on their experience' or anything generic."
