        content: `Write a cold outreach email and a subject line for it.

Structure — follow this exactly:
- Greeting: "Hi [recipient first name]," on its own line
- Sentence 1: Sender's name and school only. Example: "My name is Justin Rodriguez and I'm a freshman at Michigan."
- Sentence 2: Something specific about their firm or role that proves you read their profile, not just their headline. Reference what their firm actually does, a specific investment focus, a market they operate in, or a concrete detail from their career path. This is the most important sentence — it must go beyond their title and company name. Example: "I saw you went from Michigan straight into real estate PE at Vanbarton, which focuses on value-add multifamily in gateway cities, and have been there for 9 years."
- Sentence 3: One genuine question about their path or perspective. Simple and direct. Example: "I'd love to hear what drew you to that space."
- Sentences 4-5: The ask. Acknowledge their time with "I know you're likely busy" before making the request. Keep it to 15 minutes, low pressure. Example: "I know you're likely busy, but would you be open to a quick 15 minute call? Happy to work around your schedule."
- Sign off: "Best," on its own line, then the sender's name on the next line. Never inline with the body.

Hard rules:
- No em dashes anywhere in the email
- Never mention internships, job seeking, recruiting, or resume
- Never use any of these phrases: "came across your profile", "was impressed", "extensive experience", "would greatly appreciate", "any insights you could share", "thank you for considering", "I look forward to the possibility", "your journey", "that kind of focus is rare", "truly inspiring", "really resonated", "I hope this message finds you well", "built a strong career", "transitioned from", "eager to learn", "I'd be grateful"
- The observation in sentence 2 must reference something real about what the firm does or a concrete detail from their career — repeating their job title and company name alone is not acceptable
- Never ask for anything except a conversation
- Sound like a confident college student writing a real email, not a cover letter
- Every email must feel like it could only be sent to this exact person
- Do NOT invent details not present in the profile data or sender context

Subject line rules:
- Never use the recipient's name
- Never say "Quick Introduction" or any variant of it
- Make it specific to something in their background or the connection angle
- Curiosity-driven, like something a real person would write
- Under 8 words
- Examples: "Freshman curious about your path to PE", "Question about the jump from Wharton to SM", "Advice from someone who's been through IB recruiting"

Output:
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanation, no markdown
- Format: { "subject": "...", "body": "..." }
- The body must not include a subject line
- In the body field, use \\n for line breaks so the greeting and sign-off are on their own lines
